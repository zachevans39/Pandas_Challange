    "Observations:When analyzing these tables two things that are  very consisten about test score averages and the overall passing percentages is that students in charter schools preform better when it comes to math and reading test.  Thes second observation is that schools that spend less money per student had higher test scores and overall passing rates.  I feel like these two trends are dependent on the benefits Charter schools have over distirct scools; which is they allow for a better learning environment due to their being more availble individual attention for  student with smaller student bodies .  When looking at the top scores and lowest scores it shows the proof in these trands.  With all 5 of the top schools being charter schools and all 5 of the schools with the lowest overall passing rates are district schools with large student bodies."
